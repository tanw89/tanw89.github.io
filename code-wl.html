            <div class="content">
            The Investing Squirrel is a financial information chatbot served through a DialogFlow frontend, powered by a webhook in NodeJS. Originally, I built it to provide financial definitions for beginners. 
            <br><br>I later realised that incorporating API functionality would make it more powerful. I could perform quick checks on share prices, or pack in interactive content to function as behavioural nudges. 
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/code/squirrel/options.png"> 
            <br><br>The chatbot functions as follows: based on the user’s inputs, DialogFlow will detect the appropriate intent. If an intent requesting for share price is detected, the backend webhook will make a POST request to the AlphaVantage API which provides financial information. 
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/code/squirrel/shareprice.png">
            <br><br>
            Over time, I was able to improve the backend logic to include 2 more functions: 1) a news function:
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/code/squirrel/news.png"> 
            <br><br>
            And 2) a technical indicator function, serving 3 simple indicators for my needs (MACD, RSI and stochastics).

            <br><br>
            The Investing Squirrel is integrated with Facebook for beta testers. A raw version of it is available on Telegram (but due to limited API calls and choppy dynos from free Heroku hosting, you may experience some lag). Give it a shot and have fun!

            <h2>Richard, HDB <br> Valuation Chatbot</h2>
            <a class="close" href="#item3">&times;</a>
            <div class="content">
            The idea for “Richard” came about because many of my engaged or married friends were sourcing for a BTO flat. They wanted a quick, back-of-envelop way to verify that the valuations they were quoted were reasonable.
            <br><br>Since HDB also publishes its data openly (clean data!), and I had experience in model fitting and evaluation, I thought: why not train a model based on this data and try to predict prices based on user's inputs of their flat's info? I then conceptualised the app's structure:
            <br><br> 
            <img src="img/code/richard/architecture.png">             
            <br><br>Based on this structure, the first step was to procure the data, then to train it, and finally evaluate the models. Out of 4 models I’ve tried, the XGBoost regressor provided the best accuracy. I stored the XGBoost weights in a pickle file:
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/code/richard/weights.png"> 
	        <br><br>
	        The weights were connected by means of a Flask app to the user. The Flask script manages RESTful API requests and user's inputs, essentially allowing what the user keys in to feed into the mathematical calculations.
	        <br><br>
            <img src="img/code/richard/flaskapp.png">             <br><br>
            Lastly, for a smoother front end experience, the chatbot agent was then trained to identify different ways a user would key in the parameters such as storey, lease remaining, town, floor area and flat type. Stylistic elements to give it a local feel were also included.
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/code/richard/finaline.png">
            <br><br>
            Richard is available as a DialogFlow agent. Based on feedback from the initial test run (n=15 users), about 8 have said that the valuations were accurate. My future plans include converting the frontend into a web form, and allowing users to give feedback on whether the valuation was accurate, so that the model can reinforce its accuracy over time.
