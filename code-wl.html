        <h1>&lt;Hello World&gt;</h1>
        <div class="code-title-small"> Although I first picked up programming in 2003, it was
            only in 2017 that my affinity was rekindled through a Data Science course at General Assembly. By joining
            Kaggle data science competitions with my newly acquired skills, I learnt that these lines of machine-speak
            had potential for real impact.
            <br><br> One of my biggest "aha" moments was when my code achieved top 20% performance in a data science means testing contest -- hardly bleeding edge but very empowering to know that I
            had the tools to make a difference.
            <br><br> My next steps are to learn to create better products at <b>scale</b>. I'm hoping to learn either data engineering (Azure, AWS, streaming analytics) or product management principles to scale
            more effectively.

                <a class="close" href="#item2">&times;</a>
                <div class="content">
                    The Investing Squirrel is a financial information chatbot served through a DialogFlow frontend,
                    powered by a webhook in NodeJS. Originally, I built it to provide financial definitions for
                    beginners.
                    <br><br>I later realised that incorporating API functionality would make it more powerful. I could
                    perform quick checks on share prices, or pack in interactive content to function as behavioural
                    nudges.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="content-try">
                        <img src="img/code/squirrel/options.png">
                    </div>
                    <br><br>The chatbot functions as follows: based on the user’s inputs, DialogFlow will detect the
                    appropriate intent. If an intent requesting for share price is detected, the backend webhook will
                    make a POST request to the AlphaVantage API which provides financial information.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="content-try">

                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    Over time, I was able to improve the backend logic to include 2 more functions: 1) a news function:
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="content-try">
                        <img src="img/code/squirrel/news.png">
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    And 2) a technical indicator function, serving 3 simple indicators for my needs (MACD, RSI and
                    stochastics).
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="content-try">

                    <br><br>
                    The Investing Squirrel is integrated with Facebook for beta testers. A raw version of it is
                    available on Telegram (but due to limited API calls and choppy dynos from free Heroku hosting, you
                    may experience some lag). Give it a shot and have fun!

                <h2>Richard, HDB <br> Valuation Chatbot</h2>
                <a class="close" href="#item3">&times;</a>
                <div class="content">
                    "Richard" was the name of a neighbour I had when I was young. No prizes for correctly guessing his occupation.
                    <br><br>
                    The idea for “Richard” came about because many of my friends who were couples were sourcing for a
                    HDB flat. They wanted a quick, back-of-envelop way to verify that the valuations they were quoted
                    were reasonable.
                    <br><br>Since HDB publishes clean data on resale transactions, I thought: why not train a model with
                    this data and try to predict prices based on users' inputs of their flat's info? I then
                    conceptualised the app's structure:
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="content-try">
                        <img src="img/code/richard/architecture.png">
                    </div>
                    <br><br>Based on this structure, the first step was to procure the data, then to train it, and
                    finally evaluate the models. Out of 4 models I’ve tried, the XGBoost regressor provided the best
                    accuracy. I stored the XGBoost weights in a pickle file:
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="content-try"><img src="img/code/richard/weights.png"></div>
                    <br><br>
                    The weights were connected by means of a Flask app to the user. The Flask script manages RESTful API
                    requests and user's inputs, essentially allowing what the user keys in to feed into the mathematical
                    calculations.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="content-try">
                        <img src="img/code/richard/flaskapp.png"><br><br>
                    </div>
                    Lastly, for a smoother front end experience, the chatbot agent was then trained to identify
                    different ways a user would key in the parameters such as storey, lease remaining, town, floor area
                    and flat type. Stylistic elements to give it a local feel were also included.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="content-try">
                        <img src="img/code/richard/finaline.png">
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    Richard is available as a DialogFlow agent. Based on feedback from the initial test run (n=15
                    users), about 8 have said that the valuations were accurate. My future plans include converting the
                    frontend into a web form, and allowing users to give feedback on whether the valuation was accurate,
                    so that the model can reinforce its accuracy over time.

                <a class="close" href="#item4">&times;</a>
                <div class="content">
                    This IPYNB notebook was written for the final assignment of my Specialist Diploma in Data Science
                    (Artificial Intelligence). I enrolled in this course at Singapore Polytechnic in 2018 as I wanted to
                    sharpen the skills I have earlier gained from General Assembly.
                    <br><br>The task was a classic one: fit a neural network to the MNIST dataset and train the computer
                    to identify handwritten digits correctly. However, to challenge myself, I did some things
                    differently: a) I experimented with 3 neural networks and re-built all 3 from scratch by reading
                    through their papers rather than just importing ready-made versions, and b) I augmented the size of
                    my train set instead of using the dataset as-is.
                    <br><br> The first architecture I built was the LeNet5 architecture. I read the original paper
                    written by Yann LeCunn et al in 1998 and realised the network was certainly less complex due to the
                    (lack of) compute power back then. I reproduced it and got an error rate of about 4.8%.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="content-try">
                        <img src="img/code/3NN/lenet5.png">
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    Thereafter, I tried building two other more modern architectures. The first, ZFNet, turned out to be
                    rather massive as it was meant to recognise colour images. MNIST however was a 1-channel grayscale
                    dataset and this meant the architecture had to be scaled down. Again, I accessed the original paper
                    to get a sense of their structure, and applied proportion to scale down some convolution and pooling
                    layers. I repeated this process for VGG-16.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="content-try">
                        <img src="img/code/3NN/zfnet.png">
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, I learnt how to artificially increase the train set size by rotating the MNIST digits to
                    form new images and played around with the learning rate to get the best results. This allowed me to
                    drop my error from nearly 5% to a whopping 0.97%. The link to the notebook is provided below.

                <div class="content">
                    In this notebook, I assessed the effectiveness of various clustering algorithms applied to the
                    classic Iris dataset. 4 algorithms were tested: a) K-Means Clustering, b) Spectral Clustering, c)
                    Agglomerative Clustering, and d) DBSCAN. Various evaluation metrics were used to assess each
                    algorithm.

                    <br><br>
                    Through this unsupervised learning task, I developed a personal workflow to triangulate and get a
                    rough sense of where the optimal k value lies. This was backed up by DBSCAN, which computes its own
                    k without requiring the user’s specification. I then “subbed” this range of k values back into the 4
                    selected algorithms to see which one performed the best.
                    <br><br>

                    </div>
                    Using this workflow, I determined Spectral Clustering with a k-value of 3 to be the most effective
                    algorithm. This workflow has now entered my toolkit as a useful reference for future unsupervised
                    learning tasks. The link to the notebook is provided below.

                    I used the VGG16 neural network architecture to classify a set of food pictures. This was a project
                    in the fast.ai v1 run.
                    <br><br>
                    I first instantiated the network and then fit the data to it.

                    <br><br>
                    I was thoroughly amazed at the simplicity of the implementation and efficacy despite the small train
                    set. The results were actually pretty accurate!

                    The fast.ai syllabus really brought machine learning down from the realms of the "technical Levites"
                    to something that could be learnt and applied by mere mortals. It was one of the key turning points
                    of my journey in learning data science. You can check out the code below -- yes, it really is just a
                    few lines of code in a notebook! <br><br>

                    Using Bootstrap 4 and JS, I made a mock landing page for my own imagining of the Moments of Life
                    App. The landing page aims to explain the idea of the app in a simple way to an imagined visitor.

                    <br><br>
                    The mock screens on the app were made using, surprisingly, Powerpoint! Also, do note that I'll not be sharing the code here, as this is my own imagining of an existing product.

                <div class="content">
                    SchemesSG is a mobile app built using React Native. It is essentially a directory of various help schemes available in Singapore, inclusive of both government schemes as well as those by private bodies or NGOs. 
                    <br><br>
                    Although many government apps already exist to provide info on assistance, I felt that there was a gap in information regarding schemes disbursed at the private or local level, say by charitable organisations, individuals or even Members of Parliament. Hence I built a proof-of-concept directory as follows:  
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="content-try">
                        <img src="img/code/schemessg/ezgif-info.gif" height=55%>
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    The app also sports a simple "Add to Favourites" function made with Redux. This allows the user to go back to saved schemes for further follow-up.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="content-try">
                        <img src="img/code/schemessg/ezgif-fav.gif" height=55%>
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    I would like to see how the app can function as an "exoskeleton" to draw info from a database, which can be updated regularly with new scheme listings and information. Currently I am toying around with Firebase, but if you know of a better solution, reach out to me!

                <div class="content">
                    The UX Diaries is a journal where I record my experience and reflections of using government apps. It also details how I, as a user, would like to see these apps evolve. 
                    <br><br>
                    Built using ReactJS, I have recorded my thoughts of about 12 apps:  
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="content-try">
                        <img src="img/code/uxdiaries/appcollection.png" width=75%>
                    </div>
                    In the journal, I address 3 key areas for each app: 1) what I think users want to do through the app, 2) what the organisation is trying to achieve, and 3) how behavioural science can inform the roadmapping of features. These thought experiments help me establish design sensibilities and become more acute of my own needs as a user.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="content-try">

                    </div>
                    While I could have used a ready-made site editor, building this journal from scratch also helped me appreciate the complexities that go behind planning even a simple page. Mad kudos to dedicated React developers!

                    I'll be publishing the site soon once I create more reviews and thought experiments!
