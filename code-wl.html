            The Investing Squirrel is a financial information chatbot served through a DialogFlow frontend, powered by a webhook in NodeJS. Originally, I built it to provide financial definitions for beginners. 
            <br><br>I later realised that incorporating API functionality would make it more powerful. I could perform quick checks on share prices, or pack in interactive content to function as behavioural nudges. 
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/code/squirrel/options.png"> 
            <br><br>The chatbot functions as follows: based on the user’s inputs, DialogFlow will detect the appropriate intent. If an intent requesting for share price is detected, the backend webhook will make a POST request to the AlphaVantage API which provides financial information.

            <br><br>
            Over time, I was able to improve the backend logic to include 2 more functions: 1) a news function:
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/code/squirrel/news.png"> 
            <br><br>
            And 2) a technical indicator function, serving 3 simple indicators for my needs (MACD, RSI and stochastics).

            The Investing Squirrel is integrated with Facebook for beta testers. A raw version of it is available on Telegram (but due to limited API calls and choppy dynos from free Heroku hosting, you may experience some lag). Give it a shot and have fun!

            <div class="content">
            The idea for “Richard” came about because many of my engaged or married friends were sourcing for a BTO flat. They wanted a quick, back-of-envelop way to verify that the valuations they were quoted were reasonable.
            <br><br>Since HDB also publishes its data openly (clean data!), and I had experience in model fitting and evaluation, I thought: why not train a model based on this data and try to predict prices based on user's inputs of their flat's info? I then conceptualised the app's structure:
            <br><br> 
            <img src="img/code/richard/architecture.png">             
            <br><br>Based on this structure, the first step was to procure the data, then to train it, and finally evaluate the models. Out of 4 models I’ve tried, the XGBoost regressor provided the best accuracy. I stored the XGBoost weights in a pickle file:
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/code/richard/weights.png"> 
	        <br><br>
	        The weights were connected by means of a Flask app to the user. The Flask script manages RESTful API requests and user's inputs, essentially allowing what the user keys in to feed into the mathematical calculations.
	        <br><br>
            <img src="img/code/richard/flaskapp.png"><br><br>
            Lastly, for a smoother front end experience, the chatbot agent was then trained to identify different ways a user would key in the parameters such as storey, lease remaining, town, floor area and flat type. Stylistic elements to give it a local feel were also included.
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/code/richard/finaline.png">
            <br><br>
            Richard is available as a DialogFlow agent. Based on feedback from the initial test run (n=15 users), about 8 have said that the valuations were accurate. My future plans include converting the frontend into a web form, and allowing users to give feedback on whether the valuation was accurate, so that the model can reinforce its accuracy over time.

            <div class="content">
           This IPYNB notebook was written as part of my final assignment for a machine learning module under the Specialist Diploma in Data Science (Artificial Intelligence) which I read in 2018. The task was to fit a neural network to the MNIST handwritten digit dataset, and train the computer to identify human-written digits correctly.
            <br><br>I decided to take the assignment up a notch by doing several things: a) instead of fitting 1, I would fit 3 neural networks, b) instead of instantiating ready-made versions, I would build them ground-up from scratch, and c) instead of using the dataset as-is, I would try to augment and increase the size of my train set.
            <br><br> The first dataset I tried to build from scratch was the LeNet5 architecture. I accessed the original paper written by Yann LeCunn et al in 1998. The network certainly less complex than many of the complicated architectures written today, given the (lack of) compute power back then. I reproduced it and got about 5% error rate in the task. <br><br>
            <img src="img/code/3nn/lenet5.png">             
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/code/3nn/weights.png"> 
            I also tried two other architectures. The first, ZFNet, turned out to be more massive than needed, as they were meant to recognise colour images. They had to be scaled down because the MNIST was a 1-channel grayscale dataset. I accessed the original papers to get a sense of their structure, and applied proportion to scale down some of the convolution and pooling layers.
	        <br><br>
            <img src="img/code/3nn/zfnet.png"> 
            <br><br>
            Lastly, I also gained knowledge of how to artificially increase the train set size by rotating the MNIST digits to form new images, and played around with the learning rate to get the best results. This allowed me to drop my error rate from nearly 5% earlier, to 0.97%. The link to the notebook is provided below.

                In this IPYNB notebook, I assessed how effective various clustering algorithms were atsuss ing out the inherent number of classes in the dataset, and labelling the data in a way that mimics reality as close as possible.
                <br><br> The dataset which was used here is the classic iris dataset, and 4 algorithms were tested: a) K-Means Clustering, b) Spectral Clustering, c) Agglomerative Clustering, and d) DBSCAN. For the latter, the algorithm dictates the optimal number of clusters without needing the user’s input on “k”. Various evaluation metrics were to assess each of the 4 algorithms.
                <br><br>
                <img src="img/code/cluster/calinski.png">

                <img src="img/code/cluster/silhoutte.png">
                <br><br>
                For this task, Spectral Clustering with a k-valule of 3 proved to be the most effective. However, the magic lay not in the results, but the process. By using different metrics, I developed a unique workflow to triangulate and get a sense of where the optimal k value was roughly situated. I then “subbed” back this k value into the different selected algorithms to see which one could cluster the most effectively. this workflow has entered my toolkit, and I will use it in future for unsupervised learning tasks.
